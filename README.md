### Overview

X Marks the Spot was my first game developed in Unity in 2023. The project served as a way to demonstrate my ability to create a polished, optimized game experience. The game utilizes various Unity technologies, such as occlusion culling and LOD (Level of Detail), to ensure smooth performance and a visually appealing experience.

The game is an adventure where the player embarks on a quest to find a buried treasure on a mysterious island. Along the way, the player will encounter obstacles, collect gems while climbing the mountain, and navigate a perilous tunnel filled with traps. The ultimate goal is to find and unearth the treasure hidden at the top.

### Development & Features

Developed using Unity with the use of C#. Key milestones included:

- Incorporated occlusion culling and LOD techniques to optimize performance and maintain a seamless experience.
- Designed a variety of environments, including mountainous terrain and a deadly obstacle-filled tunnel.
- Integrated gem collection mechanics, encouraging exploration and rewarding players for thorough exploration.
- Developed the game's core mechanics, including climbing, jumping, and interaction with obstacles and the environment.
- Focused on ensuring polished gameplay and optimizing both the game's performance and user experience.

### Real-World Applications

This project provided valuable experience in game development, allowing me to apply optimization techniques like occlusion culling and LOD. It also gave me hands-on experience in creating interactive environments and understanding gameplay mechanics. The project reinforced my ability to develop polished, well-optimized games while ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Challenges & Learnings
The biggest challenge I faced during this project was manually altering the heightmap-based terrain. After sculpting the landscape, I realized that I made it very low. This was a problem since I palnned on adding multiple islands. The issue was rectified through manual modification of the heightmap. 

### Disclaimer
Assets used in the game were obtained from the Unity marketplace, while all programming and gameplay logic were implemented by me.
